#Briefly About Myself:


After working in a bank for a few years, I decided to change career and try programming, which turned out to be quite exciting,
interesting and at the same time time-consuming. That's why I decided to quit my job and dedicate myself to studying full time.
I am going to move to Austria and start working there as a Frontend developer. 
I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
